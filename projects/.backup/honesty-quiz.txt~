No. While I certainly don't think hiring a tutor is a fair to other
students who cannot, I don't think this one constitutes cheating as long as
the tutor didn't explicitly show the areas in the code where there is a
problem.
[2]
Yes, because even though that person didn't copy the code, looking at that
correct piece of code by itself would directly help them write the code
themselves, so it would be a violation.
[3]
Yes, the possession of solutions would mean that the intention of the
student is to cheat if needed.
[4a]
No, anything from the lecture should be able to discussed between students.
[4b]
Yes, describing the solution regardless of how small it is is wrong and
would constitute cheating.
[4c]
No, although I believe that it is a weird question to ask, as long as the
other person only talk about the objective of the homework assignment but
not how to reach that objective, that should be fine. Because knowing what
you are supposed to learn by doing the assignment and actually doing the
assignment are two different things.

[6]
No, as long as only the error is searched on Google and correction is done
by the student themselves, I think it is fine. Because in most situations
knowing what an error means wouldn't tell you how to solve that
error.
[7]
Yes, the moment you intentionally look at a solution, that's cheating.
