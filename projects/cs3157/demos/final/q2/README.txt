Fall 2022 Final Exam: Problem 2
-------------------------------

Files
-----

Each variation of fgtest.c is written in a different file (e.g., the variation
from 2.3 is in fgtest3.c).

The test-all.sh script is used to build and run each variation.


Running
-------

To run the code for this problem, just run:

    $ ./test-all.sh
    (( output not shown ))

The test will try to compile and run each of the different fgtest.c variations,
comparing the output with the result of the original fgtest.c.


Exploring
---------

You can poke around by modifying each of the fgtest.c variations.

The test-all.sh script is a little hacky; feel free to poke around with it, but
if you have any questions, ping the listserv or bug John about it!
