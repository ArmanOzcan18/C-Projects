# Output Buffering Examples

This repo contains a bunch of small examples demonstrating the effects of
line-buffering on stdout.  Commentary can be found in each .c file.

You must be at least familiar with the behavior of the following examples:

  - stdout-is-buffered
  - stderr-is-unbuffered
  - stdout-fflushed

As usual, run "make" to build examples.
