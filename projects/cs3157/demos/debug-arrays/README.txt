Debugging string functions
--------------------------

In each subdirectory, you'll find a .c file and a Makefile that compiles it.
As usual, run "make" to build, and run the resulting executable.

The .c files contain the broken implementation from the recitation notes.
Some are so broken that you will get a compiler warning or error; others will
behave unexpected at runtime, either crashing or giving you unexpected; others
may lead to memory errors that you can only see using valgrind.
